I am a full-stack web developer with over <b>ten years</b> of experience.

I have maintained, developed and launched multiple projects from scratch. I carried out branding, the design of UI/UX, and the development of its back-end and front-end codebases.

My current toolset includes React, Vue, TypeScript, PWA's, Express Framework and all the other various frameworks, libraries and technologies related to them.

I also used to work on websites using PHP codebases and running on Apache/NGINX servers. I used popular framework Drupal and WordPress.
